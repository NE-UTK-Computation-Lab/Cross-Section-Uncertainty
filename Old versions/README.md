# TOol For Fast Error Estimation (TOFFEE)
TOFFEE is a python script that automates cross-section uncertainty analysis using the tool available in MCNP6.2 and NJOY. The program utilizes the PERT and KSEN methods to generate sensitivities, uses NJOY to generate covariance data, and uses NUMPY to do the sandwich rule to calculate uncertainites.
